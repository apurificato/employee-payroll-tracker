# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to implement some changes to a template of preexisting files for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the primpary focus being updates and additions to the Javascript code.

This changes will have multiple benefits: allowing for the user of the webpage to be prompted for employee data and enabling them to input specific data into those prompts when they click a button. This data will then be collected, stored, and displayed in the browser console (developer tools) while simultaneously being displayed on the front end of the browser webpage.

The way that the Javascript code works in this project is for it to ultimately be inserted and appended to parts of the HTML file, allowing for new content to be displayed on the front end. 

This project helped me learn more of vanilla Javascript basics. This includes utilizing Javascript as a toolset for manipulating objects in the HTML document and browser window/ DOM. Additionally, it further helped me practice creating Javascript functions and how those functions can be used to program with Javascript in a way that is potentially useful.

## Installation and Usage

This webpage (with updated code) is deployed and ready to be viewed. Use DevTools and Inspect on a web browser in order to view the Javascript updates (as well as HTML or CSS code of the page, if interested), when viewing in a web browser such as Chrome.

As far as usage goes, click the "Add Employees" button in order to start the process of collecting employee information/data. This will take user through a series of prompts requiring input that will be stored and displayed in the browser console, as well as on the front end of the webpage, inserted into the Employee Roster table. That table will collect and display the employees' first name, last name, and salary.

Additionally, the browser console will also display the average salary information, calculated from all of the employees (and their inputed salaries), depending on what or how much information the user decides to input, based on their interaction with this application.

## Features

This webpage has a button that triggers an event, which includes a series of prompts requiring the user to input specific data/information. That information is then collected, stored, and display in the browser dev tools console, as well as inserted into the Employee Roster table on the front end of the webpage (in the browser window).

## Credits

Code changed made by Anthony Purificato as part of a Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Assignment to learn the benefits and importance of using Javascript to write functions and in manipulating the DOM, browser window, and HTML with Javascript programming and object methods.

Original Code was pulled from repository on GitLabs created for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and accessible by Rutgers Coding Bootcamp students.
